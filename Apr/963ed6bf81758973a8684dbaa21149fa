  This expansion, which will include the availability of backhoe loaders, excavators, wheel loaders, motor graders, and crawler dozers, will be sold and supported by independent, newly appointed John Deere dealers, to be announced. Impacted countries include South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Namibia, Zambia, Kenya, Uganda, Mozambique, Angola, Malawi, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Egypt, Rwanda, Burundi, South Sudan, and Sudan. “This expansion provides an opportunity for us to increase our global footprint in the construction industry, as we build upon our existing presence in Africa and deliver our product portfolio under the John Deere brand for the first time to these key markets,” Jaco Beyers, managing director for John Deere Africa Middle East. “As we move into these new countries, we are delivering on what customers expect from the John Deere brand, from the legendary product quality and performance to the exceptional customer support and equipment technologies that we are known for around the world.” In Africa, John Deere is already recognized as a leader in the agricultural market, as well as an increasingly prominent player in the construction and forestry industries in many parts of the continent. This expansion marks the first time that the John Deere construction products are sold under the John Deere name in these key markets. In this new era, John Deere is taking full control of the marketing and support of its own branded construction products. In addition to the legendary products, customers in these markets will also have access to product support through the world-renowned John Deere dealer network. Each piece of John Deere construction equipment will be supported and serviced by highly trained and certified equipment technicians who are in turn supported by a network of regional parts distribution centers, including the nearest one in Kempton Park, Gauteng, South Africa. Customers will also have access to the John Deere suite of technology solutions, including JDLink™ Telematics, which provides valuable fleet insights on the job site. News Release “We have a deep-rooted presence in Africa in the agriculture market, and we know construction customers in these markets are eager for access to the John Deere brand and its many advantages”, said Griffiths Makgate, sales manager, John Deere Construction & Forestry, John Deere Africa Middle East. “By providing access to our high-quality equipment, outstanding dealer network and parts availability, and productivity enhancing technology solutions, we can help operators in Africa increase productivity and boost their bottom lines on a daily basis.” In addition, John Deere forestry products already available in these markets, will soon be aligned with the same new dealership network. Specific dealer announcements can be expected in the coming weeks.
