  The experienced project team has commenced with mobilising resources onto the project site in Kathu in the Northern Cape who are in the initial stages of clearing vegetation from the greenfield project site. The solar project will take 8 months to construct. Aurex will execute the partial engineering, supply and full construction of the 10MW solar PV infrastructure (sub-EPC) complete with grid connection works, including the commissioning and commissioning assistance of free issued components. Once completed, this project will supply over 20 GWh of clean energy to a private customer. Stuart Kent, CEO of Aurex Constructors said, “This is a significant project award for us. Our first in the renewables sector as Aurex Constructors after the recent management buy-out. Our collaboration with SOLA will serve to strengthen the country’s power supply while our tenacious project team continues to deliver on our high-quality skills, capabilities and extensive solar experience.” The project offers employment opportunities to members of the local community during the construction phase. Once delivered to our customer the solar plant will provide stability to the existing power grid and offer further employment opportunities to the local community during the operations and maintenance phase.
